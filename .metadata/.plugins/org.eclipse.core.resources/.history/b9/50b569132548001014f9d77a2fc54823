1.Leet code Problem Number :- 274

2.Leet code Problem Name :- HIndex
 
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] 
is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, 
return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 

The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has 
published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3

Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in 
total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.

Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and 
the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
 
 Complexties:-
1. Time Complexity  :- O(log n)
2. Space Complexity :- O(1)
